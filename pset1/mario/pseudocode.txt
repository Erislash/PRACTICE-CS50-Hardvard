1) Prompt for user's input. How big will the pyramid be
    We could do this by using "get_int" function from "cs50" library

2) We HAVE to check user input to be sure it's a number between 1 and 8 (both inclusive)
    We can do this with a do-while loop

3) We have to start printing the pyramid
    The number of hashes in each row is the same as the number of the row we are in.
    As we have to print the pyramid begining on the right, we have to print white spaces until we pass a certain "column"
        and there is when we'll print hashes. That column can be calculated by

        (totalSize - rowNumber)

    After complete a row, we have to print a new line (\n)
